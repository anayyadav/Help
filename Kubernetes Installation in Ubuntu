Pre-Installation Steps On Both Master & Slave (To Install Kubernetes):
  Master:
  $ sudo su
  $ apt-get update
  Turn Off Swap Space
  Next, we have to turn off the swap space because Kubernetes will start throwing random errors otherwise.
  After that you need to open the ‘fstab’ file and comment out the line which has mention of swap partition.
  $ swapoff -a
  $ nano /etc/fstab
  edit the line start with UUID<sha> none swap
