# Components of Kubernetes
we can divide Kubernetes in to two parts:
                                    
                                          KUBERNETES
                                              |
                                              |
                        [---------------------|--------------------------]
                        |                                                |
                        |                                                | 
                 KUBERNETES MASTER                                 KUBERNETES NODE
                 |                                                        |
                 |                                                        |   
                 |-- Kube-controller manager                              |-- Kubelet
                 |                                                        |
                 |-- Kube-apiserver                                       |-- Kube-proxy
                 |                                                      
                 |-- Kube- Scheduler
                 |
                 |-- etcd(key value store)
                 
                 

# Kubernetes Master:
-> It is the central part of kubernetes
-> It manags each and every nodes.
-> It also ensures  that all the nodes are healthy or not, pods are scheduling on time etc.

# Tasks perfromed by Kubernets Master 
> Secheduling a pod 
> Respondin to any cluster event
> detecting Pods
> Exposing API
> Controlling and Provisioning
